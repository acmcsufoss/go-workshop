# go-workshop

Go workshop for ACM at CSUF.

The slides' source code is in [`acm-go.slide`](acm-go.slide). To view the
slides, head to [goworkshop.libdb.so](https://goworkshop.libdb.so).

The bookstore example is in [`cmd/bookstore`](cmd/bookstore). It contains a
full backend implementation with a REST API and a SQLite database. There's also
a small frontend in the `index.html` file.
